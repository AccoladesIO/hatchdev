data structure is basically the way we arrange data for efficient access, efficient storage and efficient manipulation
algorithms are set of instruction telling us how to achieve a task.

structures can be divided into 2
- linear structuree e.g array, linked list, queue, stack
- non linear structuree. e.g tree, graphs

Big 0 notation

- O(1): no matter the input, the algorithm runs at constant time and space 
- O(n): the algorithm runs directly proportional to the input size
- O(logn): 
Arrays: An array is a linear data structure that is a collection of elements usually of same data type
  
Linkedlist: a linkedlist is a type of data structure that has the previous element pointing the next element

-singly linkedlist is said to be the most fundamental data structure, it consist of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the linkedlist. the next of the last node is null
